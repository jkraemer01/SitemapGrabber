# SitemapGrabber
Stupid simple script to grab alot of sitemap_1.xml links in seconds based on a keyword, for use in a shopify monitor etc.

requires this module: https://www.versioneye.com/python/py-web-search/0.2

or this one I can't remember: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/google

Make sure you pip install google and this link: https://github.com/rohithpr/py-web-search/tarball/0.2

To pip install, go to your python3 folder, then to scripts and save the location. 

Then open either command prompt or powershell(if you are on windows) and type: 'cd (your file location)'

Then copy and paste this: python -m pip install https://github.com/rohithpr/py-web-search/tarball/0.2

wait for it to install, then copy and paste this: python -m pip install google

it should work, if not message my twitter @jackkraemer122

Make sure you have the 'sitemaplinklist.txt' file downloaded so it has a place to save your sitemap links

Change the config file to search for something besides 'adidas consortium'
